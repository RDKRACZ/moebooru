# Creating and deleting IMG nodes seems to cause memory leaks in WebKit, but
# there are also reports that keeping the same node and replacing src can cause
# memory leaks (also in WebKit).
#
# So we don't have to depend on doing one or the other in other code, abstract
# this.  Use ImgPool.get() and ImgPool.release() to retrieve a new IMG node and
# return it.  We can choose here to either keep a pool, to avoid constantly
# creating new ones, or to throw them away and create new ones, to avoid changing
# src.
#
# This doesn't clear styles or any other properties.  To avoid leaking things from
# one type of image to another, use separate pools for each.

    # This also encourages the browser to abort any running download, so if we have a large
    # PNG downloading that we've cancelled it won't continue and download the whole thing.
    # Note that Firefox will stop a download if we do this, but not if we only remove an
    # image from the document.
